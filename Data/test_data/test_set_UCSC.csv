    SNMP::Info - OO Interface to Network devices and MIBs through SNMP

VERSION

    SNMP::Info - Version 3.34

AUTHOR

    SNMP::Info is maintained by team of Open Source authors headed by Eric
    Miller, Bill Fenner, Max Baker, Jeroen van Ingen and Oliver Gorwits.

    Please visit <http://sourceforge.net/projects/snmp-info/> for most
    up-to-date list of developers.

    SNMP::Info was originally created at UCSC for the Netdisco project
    <http://netdisco.org> by Max Baker.

DEVICES SUPPORTED

    There are now generic classes for most types of device and so the
    authors recommend loading SNMP::Info with AutoSpecify, and then
    reporting to the mail list any missing functionality (such as neighbor
    discovery tables).

SYNOPSIS

     use SNMP::Info;

     my $info = new SNMP::Info( 
                                # Auto Discover more specific Device Class
                                AutoSpecify => 1,

This is a repository that I created while learning Bayesian Statistics. It contains links to resources such as books, articles, magazines, research papers, and influential people in the domain of Bayesian Statistics. It will be helpful for beginners who want a one-stop access to all the resources at one place.

It is a collaborative work, so feel free to pull and add content to this. This way, we will be able to make it more community-driven.

When I was a high school student on FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team 3512,
I had to learn control theory from scattered internet sources that either
weren't rigorous enough or assumed too much prior knowledge. After I took
graduate-level control theory courses from University of California, Santa Cruz
for my bachelor's degree, I realized that the concepts weren't difficult when
presented well, but the information wasn't broadly accessible outside academia.

I wanted to fix the information disparity so more people could appreciate the
beauty and elegance I saw in control theory. This book streamlines the learning
process to make that possible.

I wrote the initial draft of this book as a final project for an undergraduate
technical writing class I took at UCSC in Spring 2017

containing device drivers, CUDA runtimes, CUDA/PTX compilers, and some
utility tools. Currently it only supports NVIDIA GPUs and Linux but is,
by design, portable to other GPUs and platforms as well.
The supported API implementaions include:

- __Gdev API__: A low-level API to manage details of GPUs.
- __CUDA Driver API__: A low-level API adovocated by NVIDIA.
- __CUDA Runtime API__: A high-level API adovocated by NVIDIA.

The implementation of CUDA Driver API and CUDA Runtime API is built
on top of Gdev API. For CUDA Runtime API we make use of GPU Ocelot as
a front-end implementation. You can add your favorite high-level API
to Gdev other than CUDA Driver/Runtime APIs on top of Gdev API.

## Summary

This repo defines backend services for use within Docker.  Docker abstracts away your environment specific settings so that your code runs the same everywhere.  Each service's build environment is defined in a `Dockerfile`.  We bring up all of the services with `docker-compose.yaml`.

NGINX has been removed as a reverse proxy since we can use Heroku's router instead (and they offer more features for our already-deployed apps).  Using NGINX with the router is overkill and adds more latency.

## Getting Started

### Using the app

Each service is hosted on Heroku.  URLs are of the form `https://cruzhacks2019-SERVICENAME.herokuapp.com/`

#### Whitelist

APIs are secured with a whitelist of user/uid and pass/token request parameters.  PM a dev on the whitelist to be added.

There are also roles with access to different functions and endpoints, so make sure you're added to the right roles.

DeepPolisher is a transformer-based sequencing correction method similar to
DeepConsensus. DeepPolisher is designed to identify errors in genome assemblies.
DeepPolisher takes haplotype-specific reads aligned to phased assemblies and
produces a VCF file containing potential errors in the assembly. Currently,
DeepPolisher can take PacBio HiFi-based assemblies and read alignments to
identify potential errors.

Please see the [case study of DeepPolisher](docs/case_study.md) for
step-by-step instructions on how to polish an assembly.

## How it works

DeepPolisher works in two steps:

* `make_images`: In make images step,
DeepPolisher looks at the reads aligned to the assembly and creates tensor-like
examples of region with potential assembly errors. It encoded several features
of the region including read bases, base quality, mapping quality, match or
mismatch.

The SLUGS Autopilot offers the following features:

* Designed from the ground-up to be easily reprogrammable using Mathworks' Simulink and The Real Time Workshop Embedded Coder.

* Powered by two dsPICs DSCs; one for sensor fusion and attitude estimation from a rich sensor suite. The other for control and communications tasks, providing enough processing power for complex algorithms.

* Small enough to fit in a tactical UAV but able to drive up to ten different servos. It also includes a multiplexer to choose between pilot and automatic control

# MutationInfo

MutationInfo is a python package to extract the position, the reference and the alternative sequence of a genomic variant. It accepts variants in [dbSNP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) rs format or in [HGVS](http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/) format. 

The main purpose of MutationInfo is to simplify the process of locating a variant in a dataset (i.e. of sequences or variants) that is aligned in a human reference genome (for example hg19 or hg38). It mainly wraps a collection of existing tools with a simple interface.

Example:

from MutationInfo import MutationInfo

This repository contains the implementation of a Hybrid A* Path Planner for autonomous vehicles, specifically developed for the KTH Research Concept Vehicle. The Hybrid A* algorithm is a powerful path planning approach that combines the benefits of A* search in continuous space with a discretized set of headings. It enables the generation of efficient and smooth paths for nonholonomic vehicles navigating complex environments.

The project is about examining the sequence composition of human genome and checking the overlap between CpG islands and transcriptional starting sites.  

The dataset to be used is CpG island for Human hg19, which is obtained from UCSC Table Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) and the gene list for Human hg19, which can be obtained from `R` package `GenomicFeatures`. 


## Execute the analysis

Some `R` packages should be installed before the analysis. The required packages can be installed using `make install`.

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run `make`. This will create a file called `project.html` output in the output folder that contains the results.

Or `docker pull ivan0819/info550proj:latest` to download the built docker image. The report will be in /project/output.

# ANUBIS Benchmarks for Incremental Synthesis #

Synthesis, placement, and routing turnaround times are some of the major
bottlenecks in digital design productivity. Engineers usually wait several
hours to get accurate results to design changes that are often quite small.
Incremental synthesis has emerged as an attempt to reduce these long times, but
research in incremental synthesis currently lacks a consistent benchmark to
enable comparison between different flows and is reflective of real design
changes. ANUBIS is the first benchmark suite intended for evaluating incremental
synthesis techniques and flows. It has been presented in the [2017 International
Workshop of Logic and Synthesis](http://www.iwls.org/iwls2017). This repository
includes the verilog code for the benchmarks with code changes that can be activated
through define statements. We also included scripts to run sample flows based
that already include incremental steps.

This pipeline begins with the step of TACIT for associating enhancer activity predictions with phenotypes (step 4 of Figure 1 from Kaplow*, Lawler*, Schaffer*, _et al_., Science, 2023 (1)) and continues through the end of the pipeline; an explanation of how to implement steps 1-3 can be found near the end of this README, and details can be found in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_fVGWQ6UYhM4oBszjCu04upOu9MzQhwEzHoLJ1n2iYQ/edit?usp=sharing.

This pipeline begins with the step of TACIT for associating enhancer activity predictions with phenotypes (step 4 of Figure 1 from Kaplow*, Lawler*, Schaffer*, _et al_., Science, 2023 (1)) and continues through the end of the pipeline; an explanation of how to implement steps 1-3 can be found near the end of this README, and details can be found in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_fVGWQ6UYhM4oBszjCu04upOu9MzQhwEzHoLJ1n2iYQ/edit?usp=sharing.

This pipeline has been tested on Centos versions 7 and 8. However, we expect it to work on other distributions of Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

### About
tRNA Analysis of eXpression (tRAX) is a software package built for in-depth analyses of tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs), mature tRNAs, and inference of RNA modifications from high-throughput small RNA sequencing data. While the tRAX workflow adopts popular RNA sequencing data analysis methods, which includes adapter trimming of raw sequencing data, read alignment to the reference, transcript abundance estimation, and differential expression analysis among samples, it specifically consists of features designed to support special characteristics of tRNAs and tDRs. To ensure alignment of sequencing reads to tRNA transcripts, tRAX uses a custom-built reference database that not only includes the reference genome but also mature tRNA transcripts with the addition of 3′ CCA tail not encoded genomically.
